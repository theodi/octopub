    <h3>Step by Step: Using Octopub</h3>

    <p>First, go to <%= link_to 'the homepage', "https://octopub.io" %> and click 'Sign in with Github'</p>


    <div>
      <%= image_tag 'tutorial/step1.gif', {class: "img-responsive", alt: 'Step 1: Nav to Homepage'} %>
    </div>


    <p>If you’re not already logged into Github, you’ll be prompted to sign in to your Github account.</p>

    <div>
      <%= image_tag 'tutorial/step2.png', class: "img-responsive", alt: 'Step 2: Sign In To Github' %>
    </div>

    <p>
      Once you're signed in, you’ll see a screen like this, asking you to authorise your
      account with Octopub. We need these permissions to create and update datasets
      in Github on your behalf, and won’t use them for any other purpose:
    </p>

    <div>
      <%= image_tag 'tutorial/step3.png', class: "img-responsive", alt: 'Step 3: Authorise Octopub with Github' %>
    </div>

    <p>
      Next, click ‘Authorize application’.You’ll then be redirected to Octopub with a message telling you you’re logged in.
    </p>

    <div>
      <%= image_tag 'tutorial/step4.png', class: "img-responsive", alt: 'Step 4: You have successfully Authorized Octopub with Github' %>
    </div>

    <p>
      Next, under the ‘Datasets’ menu, click ‘Add a dataset’. You’ll then be redirected to the dataset creation page:
    </p>

    <div>
      <%= image_tag 'tutorial/step5.png', class: "img-responsive", alt: 'Step 5: Add a dataset' %>
    </div>

    <p>
      The first thing you’re asked for is the title of the dataset. Keep this short, sweet and descriptive, telling users what the dataset is about.
    </p>

    <div>
      <%= image_tag 'tutorial/step7.png', class: "img-responsive", alt: 'Step 7: Descriptively name a dataset' %>
    </div>

    <p>
      Next is the description, you can use this to give extra context to the data. This can be as long or as short as you'd like
    </p>



    <div>
      <%= image_tag 'tutorial/step8.png', class: "img-responsive", alt: 'Step 8: Add a description to your dataset' %>
    </div>

   <p> Now, provide the name and web address of the person of organisation who is publishing the data. Data users like this, so they know who to contact with any questions.</p>

    <div>
      <%= image_tag 'tutorial/step9.png', class: "img-responsive", alt: 'Step 9: Add publication details to your dataset' %>
    </div>

    <p>Next, you can choose the license. This lets people know what they can or can't do with the data</p>

    <div>
      <%= image_tag 'tutorial/step10.png', class: "img-responsive", alt: 'Step 10: Add license details to your dataset' %>
    </div>


    <p>
      The license options are as follows: <br>
    </p>

      <div style="margin-left: 5px;">
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0</p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0</p>
        <div class="license-list">Choose this license if you want anyone to use your data with the same restrictions as above, with the added requirement that anything created using your data is released under the same license</div>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">CC0 1.0</p>
        <div class="license-list">Choose this license if you want anyone to use your data with no restrictions</div>

        <div class="license-list">This license is similar to Creative Commons Attribution, but applies specifically to data</div>

      <p>You can also choose whether to publish your data privately or publicly. Only people with paid Github accounts can publish privately, so leave this to 'yes' for now.</p>



    <div class="media">
      <%= image_tag 'tutorial/step11.png', class: "img-responsive", alt: 'Step 11: Determine visibility of your dataset' %>
    </div>

    <p>Next, choose how often you think the data will be updated - this lets data reusers know if this data is likely to change


    </p>

    <div class="media">
      <%= image_tag 'tutorial/step12.png', class: "img-responsive", alt: 'Step 12: Add publication frequency details to your dataset' %>
    </div>

    <p>Now comes to nitty gritty part, adding the data. Choose a title and description for your data file, then click 'Choose file' to choose a CSV file to upload.</p>

    <div class="media">
      <%= image_tag 'tutorial/step13.png', class: "img-responsive", alt: 'Step 13: upload data files' %>
    </div>

    <p>
      Once the file has uploaded, you can scroll down and click 'Submit' to create your dataset. You'll then see a notice telling you your data has been queued for creation. Within a few minutes, you should recieve an email, with a link allowing you to see your dataset in all its glory!
